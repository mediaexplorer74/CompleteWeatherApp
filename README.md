# Quick Start (for your own experiments and code modifications)
- Clone the repo from GitHub
- Open in Visual Studio 2022
- To run the UWP sample app at WinPhone, choose target ARM
- To run the UWP sample app at Windows 10, choose target  x64 
- To run the Android sample app at Droidphone, choose Android project as startup


# Contribute!
There's still a TON of things missing from this proof-of-concept (MVP) and areas of improvement 
which I just haven't had the time to get to yet:
- UI Improvements (Hamburger menu, etc.)
- Additional Language Packages
- System Geolocation (now this thing is damaged and not tuned!)


With best wishes,
